## Building a blogging website for your career - does that makes sense in 2019?

I am sure, you might’ve heard quite a bit of debate lately about whether a graduate student need to build his own website or not. There are enormous number of talks that have recently surfaced on web where many have argued that having a website makes it easier for you to brand yourself. While many others opined that it requires a serious investment of time and resources to make and manage a blogging website. While I see these arguments as distinct “point-of-views” and would suggest you to build a website so that you can effectively share your work, make notes or communicate with like-minded people. I think websites are great tool to make your network and grow on the ‘personal” as well as “professional” front, but, like all tools, it requires a certain investment of time to manage and use it skillfully. The question should be whether a website can help you achieve your personal, academic or professional goals, rather than one need to build one or not.

Building a blogging website can require little to more technical skills. It can be build in one day using a cms tool such as Wordpress or may take few weeks depend on amount of work require to code the website from scratch. Going forward with a correct choice of website building techniques would require you to map out your purpose -- be it for personal or professional use. Whatever is your end goal, at the end of the day you need a WHY.
